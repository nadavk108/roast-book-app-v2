### Step 4: Save and Restart

1. **Save the file** (Cmd+S)
2. **Restart VS Code**
3. **Test**: Open Claude Code, type `/` and see if commands appear

## 🔄 Alternative: Skip the Config File Entirely

If the above doesn't work, **you don't actually need** `.clinerules`. Just use **manual invocation** which always works:

### How Manual Invocation Works:

Instead of typing `/exploration_phase`, you type:
```
Read and follow the instructions in claude_exploration_phase.md

Context: I want to add a share to Instagram button
```

**That's it.** Claude will read the file and follow it exactly.

## 📋 Your Complete Manual Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Session Start:**
```
Read CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md and claude_rules.md first. Ready? Here's what I need:
```

**Capture Idea:**
```
Read and follow claude_create_issue.md

Issue: [describe bug/feature]
```

**Start Feature:**
```
Read and follow claude_exploration_phase.md

Context: [what you want to build]
```

**Create Plan:**
```
Read and follow claude_create_plan.md
```

**Execute Plan:**
```
Read and follow claude_execute_plan.md
```

**Review Code:**
```
Read and follow claude_review.md
```

**Update Docs:**
```
Read and follow claude_update_docs.md
```

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Use the manual method.** It's actually more reliable across different Claude Code versions and you don't need any special config files.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works on all setups
- ✅ No hidden file issues
- ✅ More explicit (you see what you're doing)
- ✅ Can add custom context easily

**Downside:**
- Slightly more typing (but you can use Mac text replacement shortcut we set up earlier!)

## 💡 Use Your Mac Text Replacement

Remember the `ccstart` shortcut we created? **Create more for each command:**

### Go to Mac System Settings → Keyboard → Text Replacements

Add these:

| Replace | With |
|---------|------|
| `ccexplore` | `Read and follow claude_exploration_phase.md` |
| `ccplan` | `Read and follow claude_create_plan.md` |
| `ccexecute` | `Read and follow claude_execute_plan.md` |
| `ccreview` | `Read and follow claude_review.md` |
| `ccdocs` | `Read and follow claude_update_docs.md` |
| `ccissue` | `Read and follow claude_create_issue.md` |
