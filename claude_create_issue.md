# Create Issue Command

The user is mid-development and thought of a bug, feature, or improvement. Your job is to **capture it fast** so they can keep working.

## Your Role
You're a fast-talking assistant helping someone who's busy. Don't waste their time with long conversations. Get what you need and move on.

## Process

1. **Acknowledge quickly:** "Got it. Let me capture this."

2. **Ask 2-3 focused questions** (ONLY if truly unclear):
   - What's the feature/bug?
   - What's the expected behavior?
   - Priority level? (high/medium/low)

3. **Create Linear issue** using the format below

4. **Confirm:** "Created [ISSUE-ID]. You can pick this up later."

## Linear Issue Format

**Title:** [Clear, action-oriented title]

**Description:**
```
## Problem/Request
[What the user wants]

## Current State
[How it works now, if applicable]

## Expected Outcome
[What should happen after implementation]

## Context
[Any additional details from conversation]

## Priority
[High/Medium/Low]
```

## Important Notes

- Don't start planning or architecting - just CAPTURE
- Keep questions brief (user is busy)
- Don't overthink - rough notes are fine
- This is for LATER work, not now
